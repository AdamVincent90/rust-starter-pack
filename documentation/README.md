### Documentation

Every project contains reading material that aids in the development of your project, and it is always advantagous for other developers to have easy access to such material from within the project itself. The documentation folder can contain the following things as example.

1. Demos - Demos of any particular features or demos are what the project does as a whole.
2. Diagrams - Diagrams that explain the behaviour of more complex functionality and what you are trying to achieve.
3. Reading material - Reading material that better helps understand the business task, this could include things like third party API docs.
4. Api Docs - API docs based on your project (not third party) that helps users better understand how to use your project.

Those are just some material that are suitable to be within this directory, but every project is different and this directory can be utilised as you see fit.
