### Scaffold

This directory should contain any IAC or tooling that supports the project outside the scope of the source code. Scaffolding will include things that enrich your project. Good use-cases of things that would fall under scaffold would include;

1. Docker files
2. Docker Compose files
3. Database Migrations
4. Config files
5. Protobuf schemas

There is yet again many things that can fall under `scaffolding` and as usual this directory can be used as the developer feels would be benefitial.
